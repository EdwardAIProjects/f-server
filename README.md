# f-server

`f-server` is a self-hosted F-Droid-compatible repository service for many independent Android projects. CI jobs upload APKs with scoped API keys; the server verifies package scope, pins APK signing certificates on first upload, stores binaries, and republishes F-Droid index files.

## Quick start

```sh
uv sync
uv run f-server init --keystore ./repo-keystore.p12
uv run f-server keys create --label first-ci --scope '*'
uv run uvicorn f_server.main:app --reload
```

The admin panel is at `http://localhost:8000/admin`, the public repository is under `http://localhost:8000/repo`, and health checks use `GET /health`.

## Configuration

Configuration is read from `config.yaml`, `.env`, and `FS_`-prefixed environment variables. Nested values use `__`, for example `FS_STORAGE__BACKEND=s3`.

```yaml
database_url: sqlite:///./f-server.db
storage:
  backend: local
  local_path: ./data/storage
  # for S3/min.io, endpoint is used by the server and public_base_url is used in presigned redirects
  # endpoint: http://minio:9000
  # public_base_url: http://127.0.0.1:9000
repo:
  name: f-server
  description: Private F-Droid repository
  url: http://localhost:8000/repo
  keystore_path: ./repo-keystore.p12
  keystore_pass: change-me
  key_alias: f-server
  key_pass: change-me
admin_auth:
  mode: none
  session_secret: change-me
download_auth:
  mode: none
uploads:
  onboarding: tofu_scoped
  verify_signing_keys: true
```

### Configuration reference

The YAML keys below can be set in `config.yaml`. The equivalent environment variable is shown for deployments that prefer `.env` or process environment overrides. Environment variables start with `FS_`, and nested YAML keys use `__`.

| YAML key | Environment override | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `database_url` | `FS_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./f-server.db` | SQLAlchemy database URL. Use SQLite for a single local instance or Postgres for container/server deployments. |

| `storage.region` | `FS_STORAGE__REGION` | `us-east-1` | S3 region. MinIO commonly uses `us-east-1`. |
| `storage.access_key` | `FS_STORAGE__ACCESS_KEY` | unset | S3 access key. Required for MinIO unless credentials are supplied by the runtime environment. |
| `storage.secret_key` | `FS_STORAGE__SECRET_KEY` | unset | S3 secret key. Required for MinIO unless credentials are supplied by the runtime environment. |
| `repo.name` | `FS_REPO__NAME` | `f-server` | Repository name written into F-Droid index metadata. |
| `repo.description` | `FS_REPO__DESCRIPTION` | `Private F-Droid repository` | Repository description written into F-Droid index metadata. |
| `repo.url` | `FS_REPO__URL` | `http://localhost:8000/repo` | Public URL of the repository as Android clients should see it. This should normally end in `/repo`. |
| `repo.icon` | `FS_REPO__ICON` | unset | Optional repository icon setting. |
| `repo.keystore_path` | `FS_REPO__KEYSTORE_PATH` | unset | Path to the repository signing keystore. Required for signed F-Droid indexes. |

| `uploads.onboarding` | `FS_UPLOADS__ONBOARDING` | `tofu_scoped` | Upload onboarding policy. The current supported value pins the first signing certificate for an in-scope package when signing-key verification is enabled. |
| `uploads.verify_signing_keys` | `FS_UPLOADS__VERIFY_SIGNING_KEYS` | `true` | Whether uploads must match pinned APK signing certificates. Set to `false` to skip first-upload pinning and later signing-key mismatch rejection. |

The example compose stack also uses container-specific variables that are not read directly by f-server:

| Environment variable | Used by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Postgres container | Database created at first startup. Must match the database name in `database_url`. |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Postgres container | Database user created at first startup. Must match the user in `database_url`. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Postgres container | Database password created at first startup. Must match the password in `database_url`. |
| `MINIO_ROOT_USER` | MinIO container | MinIO admin/access key used by the sample stack. Must match `storage.access_key` unless you create separate credentials. |
| `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` | MinIO container | MinIO admin/secret key used by the sample stack. Must match `storage.secret_key` unless you create separate credentials. |

Upload clients and CI jobs use non-`FS_` variables because they are not configuring the server process:

| Environment variable | Used by | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FSERVER_URL` | Upload client or CI job | Base URL of the f-server instance, for example `https://f-server.example.com`. |
| `FSERVER_API_KEY` | Upload client or CI job | Bearer token created in f-server for a specific project/package scope. Store this as a CI secret. |

### Repository signing key

f-server signs the generated F-Droid repository indexes with a repository signing key. This is separate from Android app signing keys: app signing keys stay in each app's build system, while the repository key belongs to the f-server deployment and should remain stable for the life of the repository.

Create a new PKCS12 repository keystore with:

```sh
uv run f-server init \
  --keystore ./repo-keystore.p12 \
  --alias f-server
```

The command prompts for the keystore password, creates a 4096-bit RSA key, and prints the repository key fingerprint. Configure f-server to use the generated key:

```yaml
repo:
  keystore_path: ./repo-keystore.p12
  keystore_pass: change-me
  key_alias: f-server
  key_pass: change-me
```

For the compose deployment, keep the keystore in the app volume and use the in-container path from `.env.example`:

```sh
podman compose exec f-server f-server init \
  --keystore /var/lib/f-server/keystore/repo-keystore.p12 \
  --alias f-server
```

```yaml
repo:
  keystore_path: /var/lib/f-server/keystore/repo-keystore.p12
  keystore_pass: change-me
  key_alias: f-server
  key_pass: change-me
```

Back up the keystore and its password. Losing them prevents f-server from signing future updates with the same repository identity, and rotating the repository key requires clients to trust the new repository key. Do not commit the keystore or real passwords to source control.

The equivalent environment overrides are `FS_REPO__KEYSTORE_PATH`, `FS_REPO__KEYSTORE_PASS`, `FS_REPO__KEY_ALIAS`, and `FS_REPO__KEY_PASS`. All four values must be configured for signed indexes; if any are missing, f-server publishes unsigned index files. Repo signing requires `keytool`, `jarsigner`, and `apksigner` on the host or container image.

## Upload security

Every upload must pass both checks:

- API key scope: the bearer token must allow the APK package name, using exact names or globs such as `com.example.*`.
- APK signing pin: the first upload for a new package pins its signing certificate fingerprint. Later uploads must match a pinned fingerprint unless an admin adds a rotated key.

Set `uploads.verify_signing_keys=false` or `FS_UPLOADS__VERIFY_SIGNING_KEYS=false` only if package scope is sufficient for your deployment. With verification disabled, f-server still records each APK signer but does not reject signer changes.

The Android signing key is never uploaded to f-server.

## CI integration

See [docs/pushing-to-f-server.md](docs/pushing-to-f-server.md) for the full upload contract, GitHub Actions job, curl snippet, and error remediation table.

## Podman deployment

```sh
cp .env.example .env
podman compose up --build
```

Generate the repo signing keystore in the app volume before publishing APKs:

```sh
podman compose exec f-server f-server init \
  --keystore /var/lib/f-server/keystore/repo-keystore.p12 \
  --alias f-server \
  --password change-me
```

For rootless Podman bind mounts, prefer named volumes. If binding host directories for keystores or local storage, use SELinux relabeling such as `:Z` or keep user IDs aligned with `--userns=keep-id`.
