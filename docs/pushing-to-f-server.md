# Pushing APKs to f-server

f-server is a private F-Droid repository server. A project CI job uploads each APK to `POST /api/v1/upload`; f-server authenticates the project with `FSERVER_API_KEY`, verifies the APK package name is in that key's scope, pins the APK signing certificate on first upload, and publishes accepted versions to the repo index. The only prerequisite is a repository secret named `FSERVER_API_KEY` provided by the human/admin; it is minted in the admin panel under API Keys or with `f-server keys create --label ci-app --scope com.example.app`.

## Upload contract

Endpoint:

```text
POST https://f-server.example.com/api/v1/upload
Authorization: Bearer <FSERVER_API_KEY>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Multipart fields:

- `apk` required file. The Android APK to publish.
- `metadata` optional JSON string. Supported fields:

```json
{
  "name": "Example App",
  "summary": "Short app summary",
  "description": "Longer F-Droid description",
  "categories": ["Internet", "Security"],
  "changelog": "What changed in this build",
  "release_channel": "release"
}
```

- `icon` optional file. Stored as the app icon asset.
- `screenshots` optional repeated file field. Stored as localized phone screenshot assets.

## GitHub Actions job

```yaml
jobs:
  publish-fserver:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: app-release-apk
          path: dist
      - name: Upload to f-server
        env:
          FSERVER_URL: https://f-server.example.com
          FSERVER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FSERVER_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          apk="$(find dist -name '*.apk' -print -quit)"
          test -n "$apk"
          curl --fail-with-body \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FSERVER_API_KEY}" \
            -F "apk=@${apk};type=application/vnd.android.package-archive" \
            -F 'metadata={"release_channel":"release"}' \
            "${FSERVER_URL}/api/v1/upload"
```

## Raw curl

```sh
curl --fail-with-body \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FSERVER_API_KEY}" \
  -F "apk=@app-release.apk;type=application/vnd.android.package-archive" \
  -F 'metadata={"summary":"Nightly build","categories":["Tools"]}' \
  https://f-server.example.com/api/v1/upload
```

## Behavior agents must understand

- First push uses scoped trust-on-first-use. If the package is new and the API key scope allows it, f-server creates the app and pins the APK signing certificate fingerprint.
- Later pushes must be signed by a pinned certificate. A leaked API key cannot publish a differently signed APK.
- Re-uploading the same `(packageName, versionCode, signer)` is idempotent and returns the existing version.
- The Android signing key is never sent to f-server. Only the APK's public signing certificate fingerprint is extracted.

## Responses and failures

| HTTP | Result | JSON/detail shape | Remediation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | Existing version | `{"status":"exists","packageName":"...","versionCode":1,"signer":"...","apkName":"...","sha256":"..."}` | Treat as success; the upload was already published. |
| 201/200 | Created version | `{"status":"created","packageName":"...","versionCode":1,"versionName":"...","signer":"...","apkName":"...","sha256":"...","size":123,"indexFiles":["repo/index-v2.json"]}` | Treat as success. |
| 401 | Bad or missing key | `{"detail":"missing bearer token"}` or `{"detail":"invalid API key"}` | Check `FSERVER_API_KEY`, secret name, and bearer header. Ask an admin to mint a new key if revoked. |
| 403 | Out of scope | `{"detail":"package is outside API key scope"}` | Ask an admin for a key scoped to the APK package name or fix the app ID being built. |
| 403 | Missing permission | `{"detail":"API key cannot upload"}` or `{"detail":"API key cannot create new packages"}` | Ask an admin to mint a key with upload/create permission. |
| 409 | Version exists with incompatible policy | Reserved for future strict duplicate handling. | Current server returns idempotent success for same signer; for other conflicts inspect package history. |
| 422 | Cert mismatch | `{"detail":"APK signing certificate does not match pinned package key"}` | Ensure CI used the same Android signing key. For legitimate rotation, ask an admin to add the new fingerprint. |
| 422 | Unparsable APK | `{"detail":"unparsable APK: ..."}` | Verify the artifact is an APK, not an AAB, ZIP, or unsigned/corrupt file. |
| 422 | Bad metadata | `{"detail":"invalid metadata JSON: ..."}` | Send valid JSON in the `metadata` form field. |
